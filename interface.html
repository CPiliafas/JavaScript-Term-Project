/* For my audience, I designed my interface to have a more retro arcade like feel, with darker purple colors 
and a techno aesthetic. To keep the interface simple, I based it off the assignments/index pages common with the
CIT courses. I wanted to make it simple for anyone to be able to use and understand without it having to be
needlessly complex. */
